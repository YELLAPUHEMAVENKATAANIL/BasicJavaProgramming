Arrays : 
    -> That allow us to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable.
    -> Instead declaring mulitple same datatype separately  declare in one variable.
    -> For primitive arrays, elements are stored in a contiguous memory location
    -> For non-primitive arrays, references are stored at contiguous locations.
    -> Zero-based Indexing: The first element of the array is at index 0.
    -Ö«> Fixed Length: Once an array is created, its size is fixed and cannot be changed.
    -> Java array can hold both primitive types 

Basics of Arrays in Java :

1. Array Declaration: 
    -> To declare an array in Java, use the following syntax
        -> type[] arrayName;  (Example : int [] data).

2. Create an Array :
    -> To create an array, you need to allocate memory for it using the new keyword ;
        Syntax:
            -> int [] arr = new int[size];


Types of Arrays in Java :
1. Single-Dimensional Arrays
2. Multi-Dimensional Arrays

    -> Single-Dimensional Arrays :
        -> These are the most common type of arrays, where elements are stored in a linear order.

        -> int [] arr = new int[size] or int [] arr = {10,20,30,40,50}

    -> Multi-Dimensional Arrays :
        -> Arrays with more than one dimension, such as two-dimensional arrays (matrices).

        -> int [][] arr = new int [size][size];
                        or
        -> int [][] arr = {
            {10,20,30},
            {40,50,60},
            {70,80,90}  
        }
