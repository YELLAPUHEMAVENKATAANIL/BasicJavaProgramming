String : 
    -> String is the type of object that can store a sequence of characters enclosed by double quotes,
     and every character is stored in 16 bits, i.e., using UTF 16-bit encoding
     -> strings allowing for various operations such as concatenation, comparison, and manipulation.

     Ways of Creating a Java String :
        -> String literal 
        -> By using new KeyWord


    1. String literal (Static Memory) :
        -> To make Java more memory efficient (because no new objects are created if it exists already in the string constant pool).
        -> It was created in string pool or constant pool
        -> String literals are stored in the read-only section of memory
        -> These string are Immutable we cannot chanage.
        -> Java uses string interning, so identical string literals share the same memory location


         Example : 
            -> String str = "Venkata Anil";

    2. using new KeyWord : 
        -> String s = new String("Welcome");
        ->  JVM will create a new string object in normal (non-pool) heap memory
        -> In the given example only one object will be created. 
        -> Firstly JVM will not find any string object with the value "Welcome" in the string constant pool, so it will create a new object.
        -> After that it will find the string with the value "Welcome" in the pool, 
        -> it will not create a new object but will return the reference to the same instance.

        Example :
            -> String str  = new String("venkata Anil");
