    variables :
        -> Variables are containers that store data in memory. 
        -> variables plays a very important role as it defines how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated.

    ----- Key Components of variables ---- 
        -> DataType : Defines the kind of data stored  (Example:Int,String,float,double)
        -> VariableName : A unique identifier following Java naming rules.   (Example : int number => Number is VariableName)
        -> Value : The actual data assigned to the variable.  (Example : int Number = 10;)
                                                                                       |->  10 is Value

            Examples :
                int Number = 10;
                String Name = "Anil";
                float pi = 3.14;


                                        ---- Types of Java Variables ----
                                                        |
                             ___________________________|___________________________ 
                             ↓                          ↓                           ↓
                            Local Variables             Instance Variables          static Variables



        1.Local Variables  : A variable defined within a block or method or constructor is called a local variable. 
            ->  Local variables are works inside function ,it will not work outside function.

            Example code:
                class Main{
                    public static void main(String[] args){
                        int num1 =10;  //  declared as Local variable

                        system.out.println(num1);
                         
                    }
                }

        2.Instance Variables :
            -> Instance variables are known as non-static variables and are declared in a class outside of any method, constructor, or block.
            -> The variables are declared inside class outside the function or method
            -> The Instance variables we can use inside the functions also.
            
            Example Code:
             public class Person{
                // Instance variables

                String Name;
                int age;

                // Method to display person details
                void displayInfo() {
                    System.out.println("Name: " + name);
                    System.out.println("Age: " + age);
                }
                public static void main(String[] args){

                    Person p1 = new Person();  // creating a object
                    p1.name = "Anil";
                    p1.age = 20;

                    p1.displayInfo();
                }
             } 

        3. static variables:
            -> Static variables are also known as class variables. 
            -> These variables are declared similarly to instance variables. 
            -> The difference is that static variables are declared using 
                the static keyword within a class outside of any method, constructor, or block


            Example Code: 

            public  class Main{
                // static variable
                static int count =0;

                // static Method
                static void increseCount(){
                    count++;
                    System.our.println(count);
                }

                public static void main (String[] args){
                    increseCount();
                    increseCount();
                }
            }
