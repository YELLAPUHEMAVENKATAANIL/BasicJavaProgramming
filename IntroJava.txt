Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc. in May 1995 may later aquired by oracle
Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
It is intended to let application developers Write Once and Run Anywhere (WORA), 
meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation

                                Key Features of Java


    1. Platform Independent  
    2. Object-Oriented Programming
    3.Simplicity
    4.Robustness
    5.Security
    6.Distributed
    7.Multithreading 
    8.Portability  
    9.High Performance 


    How java code is Executes?

    1. Creating the Program  
        -> Java programs are written using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, vscode;
        -> The source code is saved with a .java extension (example - hello.java)
        -> The file name and class name should be Same .

    2. Compiling the Program 
        ->The Java compiler (javac) converts the source code into bytecode, which is stored in a .class file 
        ->This bytecode is platform-independent and can be executed on any machine with a JVM.
        ->Syntax to compile a program   (javac filename.java) (example -> javac hello.java)

    3.Running the Program
        ->The JVM executes the compiled bytecode, translating it into machine code specific to the operating system and hardware.

    Example code :
    class hello{
        public static void main(String[] args){
            system.out.println("Hello World!!");
        }
    }
