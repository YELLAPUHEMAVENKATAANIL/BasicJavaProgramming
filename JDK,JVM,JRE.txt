1. Java Virtual Machine(JVM)
    -> The JVM is an integral part of the Java platform.
    ->Jvm is responsible for executing byte code.


2. Bytecode
    -> Bytecode is the intermediate representation of Java code, generated by the Java compiler. 
    -> It is platform-independent and can be executed by the JVM.

3.Java Development Kit(JDK)
    ->Java development kit that includes everything including compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Java Debuggers, Java Docs, etc. 
    ->For the program to execute in java, we need to install JDK on our computer in order to create, compile and run the java program.

4. Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
    ->JDK includes JRE. 
    ->JRE installation on our computers allows the java program to run, however, we cannot compile it. 
    ->JRE includes a browser, JVM, applet support, and plugins. For running the java program, a computer needs JRE.
